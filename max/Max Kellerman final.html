<p>Max Kellerman is leaving ESPN's First Take after many years of episodes. Apparently Steven A. Smith wanted him off the show due to them not being able to "connect with the audience". 
    Steven A. Smith wants to rotate amongst guest debaters to give it a little bit of flavor.
    Steven A. Smith claims that it's not personal it's just business. Now Max is going to be on his own radio morning show Jay Williams and Keyshawn Johnson.
    This big move will change the direction of the show which Steven A. Smith has control over due to him being one of the highest paid sports analyst at ESPN.   </p>
